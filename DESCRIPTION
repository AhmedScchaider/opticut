Description: Likelihood based optimal partitioning for indicator
  species analysis. Finding the best binary partition for each species
  based on model selection, possibly controlling for modifying/confounding
  variables as described in Kemencei et al. (2014, Community Ecology 15:180--186).
  The package also implements various measures of uncertainty based on
  binary partitions, optimal multinomial partitioning, and exploratory
  selection indices, with native support for parallel computations.
